# APPM 4600



This repository is by Darius Mirhosseini, and it's for storing all the work done for the labs and the homework in APPM 4600, Numerical Analysis. The repo is separated into two separate folders, one for the labs, and the other for any code that is needed to complete the homework assignments. The code will be written in python, so all files will have a .py extension. The code is written in sublime text, and run in terminal.
